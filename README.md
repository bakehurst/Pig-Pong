# Pig-Pong
A variant of the classic pong game, developed as a teaching project with my 12 year old grandson Jules.  We had some fun exploring css3 animations and some different JavaScript techniques.  As Jules speaks French as his first language all the displayed text is in French and some of the JavaScript names.  The displayed text language can easily be changed by editing the html.  The game play was designed by Jules to be simple enough for his young sister to understand and play.  We tried to keep the code relatively simple. The must important decision was to design the game with only one ball in play at any one time, as this avoids doing multiple collision detections and also the use of vectors which Jules has not yet learned at school.  The images and sound assets are royalty free, but cannot be used for commercial purposes, so if you have this intention you must replace them with assets you have correctly licensed.   Other wise feel free to use the project in any way you wish
